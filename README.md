## How migration-to-aws and ai-to-aws Work Together

**migration-to-aws** handles assessment and planning — it scans your infrastructure (Terraform, billing, source code), maps services to AWS equivalents, estimates costs, and generates validated Terraform configurations and migration scripts.

**ai-to-aws** handles execution for AI/LLM migrations — it takes the assessment from migration-to-aws, rewrites your SDK calls to Amazon Bedrock's Converse API, runs quality evaluation against a golden dataset, and delivers the changes on a git branch ready to merge. (On platforms without subagent dispatch it runs in inline mode — slower, but fully functional.)

## Repository Structure

Each top-level folder is owned by a team and contains their plugins, tools, or resources:

```
awslabs/startups/
├── .claude-plugin/marketplace.json   # Plugin marketplace (lists all plugins)
├── migrate/                          # Migration tools and plugins
│   └── plugins/
│       ├── migration-to-aws/         # Assess & plan
│       └── ai-to-aws/                # Execute (AI/LLM migrations)
├── solution-architecture/            # Solution Architecture plugins (aws-dev-toolkit)
└── ...                               # Future team folders
```

## Adding a Plugin

To add a new plugin to the marketplace:

1. Create your plugin under your team's folder (e.g., `migrate/plugins/my-plugin/`)
1. Include a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest in your plugin directory
1. Add an entry to the root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "source": "./my-team-folder/plugins/my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "What your plugin does"
}
```

1. Submit a PR — requires approval from `@awslabs/startups-admins` (for marketplace changes) and your team's CODEOWNERS (for plugin content)
