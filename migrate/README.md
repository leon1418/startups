# Migration to AWS

AI agent skills for migrating workloads to AWS, built for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) and [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/).

## What This Does

Point this plugin at your codebase, Terraform files, or GCP billing data. It runs a structured 6-phase migration assessment — discovering what you have, asking the right questions, designing the AWS architecture, estimating costs with real pricing data, and generating runnable migration artifacts.

**For AI-focused startups**, it goes further:

- **Detects your entire AI stack** — not just "you use GPT-4o" but your agents, tools, orchestration patterns, memory layers, and multi-model pipelines
- **Recommends three migration paths** for agentic workloads: retarget (keep your framework, swap models), AgentCore Harness (config-based managed agents), or Strands Agents (AWS-native multi-agent SDK)
- **Surfaces options you wouldn't find on your own** — like Strands Agents (open-source, powers AgentCore internally) and AgentCore Harness (declare an agent in 3 API calls)
- **Generates runnable artifacts** — `harness.json`, deployment scripts, incremental migration scripts, provider adapters — tailored to your specific models, tools, and architecture
- **Gives honest pricing comparisons** — finds you the best Bedrock option for your workload with current pricing data, including side-by-side cost comparisons against your existing OpenAI/Gemini spend

## Installation

### Claude Code

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add awslabs/startups

# Install the plugin
/plugin install migration-to-aws@startups-for-aws
```

### Cursor

> **Coming soon** — This plugin is not yet published on the Cursor Marketplace. In the meantime, you can use it locally by cloning this repository and pointing Cursor to the plugin directory at `migrate/plugins/migration-to-aws`.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install the plugin (see above)

# 2. cd into a project with Terraform, app code, or GCP billing exports
cd path/to/your/gcp-project

# 3. Trigger the skill
"migrate from GCP to AWS"
```

The skill creates a `.migration/<MMDD-HHMM>/` directory in the current working directory and writes all artifacts there.

## Workflow

1. **Discover** — Scan Terraform files, application code, and/or billing data. Detects GCP resources, AI models, agentic frameworks, tools, and orchestration patterns.
2. **Clarify** — Ask targeted questions about migration preferences, AI priorities, agentic migration approach, memory requirements, and timeline. **Mandatory** — cannot be skipped.
3. **Design** — Map GCP services to AWS equivalents. For AI workloads: select Bedrock models with honest pricing comparison. For agentic workloads: design AgentCore Harness config or Strands architecture.
4. **Estimate** — Calculate monthly AWS costs using real-time pricing data. Compare to current GCP/OpenAI spend.
5. **Generate** — Create migration artifacts: Terraform, provider adapters, `harness.json`, deployment scripts, incremental migration scripts, and documentation.
6. **Feedback** _(optional)_ — Collect anonymized feedback to improve the tool.

## What You Get That a Base LLM Can't

| Regional validation      | Outdated region lists             | Live `get_regional_availability` MCP call — catches "AgentCore Harness isn't in your target region" before you commit                                 |
| Cost estimation          | Stale pricing                     | Three-tier pricing: cached current rates, live AWS Pricing API, fallback. Shows ±5-10% accuracy.                                                      |

| Incremental migration    | Not suggested                     | Run existing OpenAI models on AgentCore infrastructure today, A/B test with Bedrock per-invocation, swap when confident                               |
