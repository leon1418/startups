# Migration to AWS

AI agent skills for migrating workloads to AWS, built for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview), [Codex](https://openai.com/codex), and [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/).

## What This Does

Point this plugin at your Heroku account (via your authenticated Heroku CLI, read-only and consent-gated), your Terraform files, application code, or billing data. It runs a structured 6-phase assessment — discovering what you have, asking the right questions, designing the AWS architecture, estimating costs with real pricing data, and generating runnable migration artifacts.

**Supported migration sources:**

- **GCP → AWS** — Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, GKE, Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage, VPC, and AI/agentic workloads
- **Heroku → AWS** — Dynos (→ Elastic Beanstalk by default; Fargate or EKS overrides), Postgres, Redis, Kafka, Private Spaces, Pipelines, and 13+ common add-ons

**For infrastructure migrations:**

- **Maps your GCP resources to AWS equivalents** — Cloud Run → Fargate, Cloud SQL → RDS or Aurora (based on availability requirements), GKE → EKS, Cloud Storage → S3, VPC → VPC, and more
- **Generates production-ready Terraform** — `vpc.tf`, `compute.tf`, `database.tf`, `security.tf`, `baseline.tf` with security controls (GuardDuty, CloudTrail, IMDSv2, ECR scanning), and a full `terraform/README.md`
- **Selects the right database migration tool** — pg_dump for small databases, pgcopydb for parallel copy at scale, AWS DMS for zero-downtime migrations — based on your actual database size
- **Produces numbered migration scripts** — prerequisites validation, data migration, container image migration (GCR → ECR), secrets migration (GCP Secret Manager → AWS Secrets Manager), and post-migration validation
- **Estimates monthly costs across three tiers** — Premium, Balanced, and Optimized — using real-time AWS pricing, compared against your current GCP spend

**For AI and agentic migrations:**

- **Detects your entire AI stack** — not just "you use GPT-4o" but your agents, tools, orchestration patterns, memory layers, and multi-model pipelines
- **Recommends three migration paths** for agentic workloads: retarget (keep your framework, swap models), AgentCore Harness (config-based managed agents), or Strands Agents (AWS-native multi-agent SDK)
- **Gives honest pricing comparisons** — finds the best Bedrock option for your workload with current pricing data, including side-by-side estimated monthly cost comparisons against your existing OpenAI/Gemini spend
- **Generates runnable AI artifacts** — `harness.json`, provider adapters, deployment scripts, incremental migration scripts — tailored to your specific models, tools, and architecture

**For running AI agents on AWS (agent-advisor):**

- **Recommends the right runtime** — deterministic scoring picks AgentCore, ECS/EKS, Lambda, AWS Batch, or Lambda MicroVMs for your agent, based on session duration, traffic shape, isolation, memory, and ops preferences — not a generic "use AgentCore"
- **Decomposes multi-workload systems into units** — a system of several agents, batch jobs, and services is broken into workload units, each scored independently, with a consolidation option (one platform vs best-fit-per-unit) and a whole-system architecture
- **Handles Temporal workers** — self-hosted or Temporal Cloud; worker polling tiers and Activity execution classes become units, Workflow orchestration code is never rewritten
- **Generates a layered recommendation, a migration plan, and a deployable POC** — from "which runtime" through a full plan (reusing the migration engine) to runnable proof-of-concept code and deploy scripts on the chosen runtime
- **Not a cloud migration** — this is the entry point for deciding how and where to run agents on AWS, whether you're building fresh, deploying existing code, or adding AgentCore capabilities to agents already on AWS

## Installation

### Claude Code

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add awslabs/startups --sparse migrate/plugins

# Install the plugin
/plugin install migration-to-aws@startups
```

### Codex

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add awslabs/startups
codex plugin install migration-to-aws
```

### Cursor

Install from the [Cursor Marketplace](https://cursor.com/marketplace) (AWS Agent Plugins collection):

1. Open **Cursor Settings**
2. Go to **Plugins**
3. Search for **AWS** or **Migration to AWS**
4. Click **Add to Cursor** and choose user or workspace scope
5. Confirm it appears under **Plugins → Installed**

Requires [Cursor >= 2.5](https://cursor.com/changelog/2-5). See the [Cursor plugins documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/plugins) for details.

> **Note:** Cursor installs are distributed via the [Agent Plugins for AWS](https://github.com/awslabs/agent-plugins) marketplace. Claude Code and Codex installs use the `awslabs/startups` marketplace above.

**Alternative (local development):** Clone this repository and symlink the plugin directory to `~/.cursor/plugins/local/migration-to-aws`, then reload Cursor.

## How to Use

After installation, just describe what you want to migrate:

**GCP migrations:**

- "Migrate my GCP infrastructure to AWS"
- "Move my Cloud Run services to Fargate"
- "Migrate my OpenAI app to Amazon Bedrock"
- "Estimate AWS costs for my GCP workload"
- "Migrate my LangChain agents to AWS"

**Heroku migrations:**

- "Migrate my Heroku app to AWS"
- "Discover my Heroku apps and estimate AWS costs"
- "Move my Heroku Postgres to RDS"
- "Migrate from Heroku to Fargate"
- "Migrate from Heroku to Elastic Beanstalk"
- "Estimate AWS costs for my Heroku workload"
- "Migrate my Heroku Private Space to AWS"

**Running AI agents on AWS (agent-advisor):**

- "Which runtime should I use for my agent — AgentCore, ECS, EKS, or Lambda?"
- "Deploy my LangGraph agent on AWS and build a POC"
- "I have an agent idea — what should I build on AWS?"
- "Migrate my Temporal workers to AWS"
- "I'm already on AWS and want to add AgentCore memory/gateway to my agent"

GCP/Heroku migrations write a `.migration/<session>/` directory; agent-advisor writes a `.agent-advisor/<session>/` directory. Both land in the current working directory with all artifacts.

**Live Heroku discovery — how it works:** No Terraform or exports needed. If `heroku login` works in your terminal, just ask — the agent requests your consent, then inventories your account using read-only list/info CLI commands. It captures app names, dyno types, add-on plans and prices, domains, pipelines, and config var **key names only**. It never reads config var values, credentials, or your API token, and never runs a command that creates, changes, or deletes anything. If you also have `heroku_*` Terraform, the agent cross-checks it against your live account and reports drift.

| Databases      | Heroku Postgres → RDS or Aurora (plan-matched sizing, DMS/pg_dump/bucardo/wal-g migration methods)                                                                         |

| Agentic migration        | "Swap ChatOpenAI for ChatBedrock" | Detects your framework, agents, tools, orchestration pattern; recommends retarget vs Harness vs Strands with effort ranges |

| Framework gotchas        | Not covered                       | LangGraph checkpointer incompatibility, CrewAI hierarchical failures with smaller models, async thread pool exhaustion     |
| Regional validation      | Outdated region lists             | Live `get_regional_availability` MCP call — catches "AgentCore Harness isn't in your target region" before you commit      |
| Generated code           | Generic templates                 | Your model IDs, your tool names, your system prompts, your region — in runnable scripts                                    |
| Incremental migration    | Not suggested                     | Run existing OpenAI models on AgentCore infrastructure today, A/B test with Bedrock per-invocation, swap when confident    |

## Requirements

- Claude Code >=2.1.29, Codex (latest), or [Cursor >= 2.5](https://cursor.com/changelog/2-5)
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- At least one input source: an authenticated Heroku CLI (Heroku migrations), Terraform files, application code, or billing data
- **For GCP AI/agentic migration:** Application source code is required (billing/IaC alone cannot detect agent architecture)
- **For Heroku migration:** an authenticated Heroku CLI (recommended — live, read-only discovery with your consent) or Terraform files with `heroku_*` resources (Procfile/app.json supplements but cannot stand alone). When both are available, live data is authoritative for current state and Terraform drift is surfaced.
- **For agent-advisor:** `uv` (for deterministic scoring); application source code when deploying/migrating existing agents (an idea-only run needs no code)
