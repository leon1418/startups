# Migration to AWS

AI agent skills for migrating workloads from GCP to AWS, built for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview), [Codex](https://openai.com/codex), and [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/).

## What This Does

Point this plugin at your Terraform files, application code, or GCP billing data. It runs a structured 6-phase assessment — discovering what you have, asking the right questions, designing the AWS architecture, estimating costs with real pricing data, and generating runnable migration artifacts.

**For infrastructure migrations:**

- **Maps your GCP resources to AWS equivalents** — Cloud Run → Fargate, Cloud SQL → RDS or Aurora (based on availability requirements), GKE → EKS, Cloud Storage → S3, VPC → VPC, and more
- **Generates production-ready Terraform** — `vpc.tf`, `compute.tf`, `database.tf`, `security.tf`, `baseline.tf` with security controls (GuardDuty, CloudTrail, IMDSv2, ECR scanning), and a full `terraform/README.md`
- **Selects the right database migration tool** — pg_dump for small databases, pgcopydb for parallel copy at scale, AWS DMS for zero-downtime migrations — based on your actual database size
- **Produces numbered migration scripts** — prerequisites validation, data migration, container image migration (GCR → ECR), secrets migration (GCP Secret Manager → AWS Secrets Manager), and post-migration validation
- **Estimates costs across three tiers** — Premium, Balanced, and Optimized — using real-time AWS pricing, compared against your current GCP spend

**For AI and agentic migrations:**

- **Detects your entire AI stack** — not just "you use GPT-4o" but your agents, tools, orchestration patterns, memory layers, and multi-model pipelines
- **Recommends three migration paths** for agentic workloads: retarget (keep your framework, swap models), AgentCore Harness (config-based managed agents), or Strands Agents (AWS-native multi-agent SDK)
- **Gives honest pricing comparisons** — finds the best Bedrock option for your workload with current pricing data, including side-by-side cost comparisons against your existing OpenAI/Gemini spend
- **Generates runnable AI artifacts** — `harness.json`, provider adapters, deployment scripts, incremental migration scripts — tailored to your specific models, tools, and architecture

## Installation

### Claude Code

# Install the plugin
/plugin install migration-to-aws@startups
```

## How to Use

After installation, just describe what you want to migrate:

- "Migrate my GCP infrastructure to AWS"
- "Move my Cloud Run services to Fargate"
- "Migrate my OpenAI app to Amazon Bedrock"
- "Estimate AWS costs for my GCP workload"
- "Migrate my LangChain agents to AWS"

The skill creates a `.migration/<session>/` directory in the current working directory with all artifacts.

## What You Get That a Base LLM Can't

**Infrastructure:**

| Capability                 | Base LLM          | This Plugin                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Terraform generation       | Generic templates | Your actual GCP config translated — instance classes, storage sizes, region, VPC CIDRs, security groups  |
| Security baseline          | Not included      | `baseline.tf` always emitted: GuardDuty, CloudTrail, IMDSv2, ECR scanning, EBS encryption, budget alerts |
| Database migration tooling | "Use DMS"         | Selects pg_dump / pgcopydb / DMS based on your actual database size; generates the right script          |
| Cost estimation            | Stale guesses     | Three-tier pricing (Premium/Balanced/Optimized) using live AWS Pricing API, compared to your GCP bill    |
| Migration plan             | Generic checklist | Phased timeline with Go/No-Go gates, rollback procedures, and data integrity checks                      |

**AI/Agentic:**

| Capability               | Base LLM                          | This Plugin                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model recommendation     | Generic "use Bedrock"             | Your specific models mapped with pricing, honest stay-or-migrate recommendation per model                                  |
| Agentic migration        | "Swap ChatOpenAI for ChatBedrock" | Detects your framework, agents, tools, orchestration pattern; recommends retarget vs Harness vs Strands with effort ranges |
| Multi-model coordination | Generic advice                    | Warns about re-embedding requirements, cascade pair testing, tiered strategies — based on your actual model usage          |
| Framework gotchas        | Not covered                       | LangGraph checkpointer incompatibility, CrewAI hierarchical failures with smaller models, async thread pool exhaustion     |
| Regional validation      | Outdated region lists             | Live `get_regional_availability` MCP call — catches "AgentCore Harness isn't in your target region" before you commit      |
| Generated code           | Generic templates                 | Your model IDs, your tool names, your system prompts, your region — in runnable scripts                                    |
| Incremental migration    | Not suggested                     | Run existing OpenAI models on AgentCore infrastructure today, A/B test with Bedrock per-invocation, swap when confident    |

## Requirements

- Claude Code >=2.1.29, Codex (latest), or [Cursor >= 2.5](https://cursor.com/changelog/2-5)
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- At least one input source: Terraform files, application code, or GCP billing data
